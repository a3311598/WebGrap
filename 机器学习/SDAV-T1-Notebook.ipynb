    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been asked to examine a sample of network traffic to investigate suspicious activity on some of the company workstations. The company directors need to be able to understand this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to produce a series of different visual representations to describe and understand the characteristics of the data. As a bare minimum, you should show at least 1 line chart, 1 bar chart, and 1 scatter plot. For each chart, you need to decide what data is useful for the chart representation, and how you can manipulate the raw data appropriately for this. You should then also provide a brief caption for each chart that describes what data is used, what the data shows, and what insight this may provide for furthering this investigation. The examples given below should help steer you to decide what charts would be appropriate - you may also explore other data for your charts where informative also.\n",

    "| **Bar chart (20%)**  | No bar chart presented or major errors in the method used | Chart is visible using provided data, but some minor errors | Bar chart that depicts the volume of activity for each observed protocol |\n",
    "| **Scatter plot (20%)**  | No scatter plot presented or major errors in the method used | Chart is visible using provided data, but some minor errors | Scatter plot that depicts the source/destination IP pairs |\n",
    "| **Markdown (40%)**  | No markdown presented or major errors in the method used | Some limited use of Markdown | All charts are clearly described using Markdown notation |\n",
